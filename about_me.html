      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="about_text">
        Born 1987 in San Fernando, Trinidad. Moved to the United States just before the age of 8. Grew up in various suburbs outside of Los Angeles. My interest in Film School brought me to the city. Eventually I decided I needed a change of pace from Los Angeles and now reside in Portland where I began code school at Epicodus. I've always been interested and around computers. My mother was in network security and my father a programmer. I was at home quarantining during the covid-19 crisis and realized that I may never get another shot to dedicate my full time to school and I took the plunge. <span class="risk"><strong><em>I love a risk and a challenge!</em></strong></span>
